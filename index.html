                    <h2>About Us</h3>
                        <p>Since establishing our shop in 2019 Fade Zone Barbers have pushed to restore the reputation and image of the traditional menâ€™s barbershop to what it once was, the cornerstone of society where families are made to feel comfortable
                            and welcome, and where men of all ages know they'll get a professional and thorough service from people they trust.<br>Having seen the typical barbershop become a place which men would avoid having to visit through fear of what
                            they'll be paying for, we've managed to use a combination of oversized mirrors, top of the range traditional barber chairs and incense to reinvent and revive what had become a tired and forgotten industry.<br>We're happy to be
                            part of your monthly routine, your local social gathering place where people come for more than just a haircut, they come for a chat, a laugh, a confidant, or a moan, because our customers can count on a genuine person ready
                            to greet them at the door!<br>We're not just passionate barbers, we're passionate people who want to give you everything you'd expect from a genuine barbershop experience, and enjoy it with you.<br>Come and take a seat, you'll see
                            that we're so much more than just a barbershop!
