Fade Zone Barbers
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a website I have created for a fictitious barbershop known as "Fade Zone Barbers". I chose to create my own project to demonstrate my capabilities of HTML/CSS. The website contains a home page that includes content about the barbershop and the pricelist, the gallery page includes a functioning gallery to showcase some haircuts, and a contact page for the user to make an enquiry.

UX
User stories
As a user I expect to have a positive emotional experience on the website.

As a customer I expect to see content relative to the barbershop.

Strategy
My goal in the design was to make the user feel connected with the barbershop, I endeavoured to have a minimalist approach to avoid overcrowding the page.

Scope
For customers, I wanted to create a website that will create the positive user experience that entices them to visit the shop.

Structure
I wanted the home page to contain important information about the barbershop so the user is greeted with this when they first load the website.

Skeleton
Home wireframe

Surface
The monochrome color scheme was to provide a sleek and balanced structure to the website.

Credits
Content
The "About Us" content in the home page section in this website were taken from https://www.headcase-barbers.com/.

Media
All photos were taken from Pexels, a stock image library. And a slightly transparent filter was applied to the "About Us" hero image to lower the brightness

Acknowledgements
I used the following tutorial on https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_four_columns.asp to learn how to set up my grid structure on the Gallery page.
